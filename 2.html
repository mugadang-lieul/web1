<h1>HTML</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="Html5 specification"> Hipertext Markup Language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web application.<br>
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.<br>
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p><p style="margin: 30px;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be
embedded into the rendered page.<br> It provides a means to create structured documents by
denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, patagraphs, losts, links,
quotes and other items.<br> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
